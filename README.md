# bigmlflow
Library for the integration and deployment of [BigML](https://bigml.com) models
using [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/).

## Introduction

All the resources generated by the `BigML` API-first platform, including
models, are totally white-box, and they can be downloaded as JSON and used
to predict anywhere. The `bigmlflow` library uses
[BigML's Python bindings](https://bigml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/local_resources.html)
to integrate with `MLFlow` tracking and deploying capacities.

The [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md) file shows a few use cases
a full training example to demo the logging and tracking of `BigML's models`
using `MLFlow`.
