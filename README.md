# BigMLFlow

This library defines the connectors needed for the integration and
deployment of [BigML](https://bigml.com) models using
[MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/).

## Introduction

All the resources generated by the `BigML` API-first platform, including
models, are totally white-box, and they can be downloaded as JSON and used
to predict anywhere. The `bigmlflow` library uses
[BigML's Python bindings](https://bigml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/local_resources.html)
to integrate with `MLFlow` tracking and deploying capacities.

The [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md) file shows a few use cases
that cover some of the Supervised Models available in BigML and
a full training example to demo the logging and tracking of `BigML's models`
using `MLFlow`.

## Installation

This library is available as a Pypi package. To install it, just run:

```bash
    pip install bigmlflow
```

## Tests

The `tests` directory contains some tests for the logging of models.
We use `Pytest` to run the tests, so you can install it separately

```bash
    pip install pytest
```

or as an extra for development and testing purposes

```bash
    pip install -e .[tests]
```
